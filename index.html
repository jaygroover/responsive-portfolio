<h2>About Me</h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/Jaypic.jpg" class=floatright alt="my picture" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin-right:15px;margin-top: 57px"></p> 
<p>My name is James Groover, but my friends all call me Jay.  I was born and lived most of my life in the small town of Statesboro, Ga.  I graduated from Bulloch Academy and attended GSU for 4 years. I managed the local steakhouse for 12 years, R.J.'s.  It was during this time that I met my wife, Kellie.  She managed the local Blockbuster.  We were engaged after only two months and after a two year engagement we were married.  We welcomed our first son, Noah into the world 7 years later. We later welcomed our second son Ethan.  My family is the most important thing to me. They are the reason that I am taking this challenging course.  I hope to be able to spend more time with them and to be home more to help raise our two boys.</p>
<p>I currently work as a sales consultant at Havertys furniture. Havertys is a great place to work and full of fun and interesting people. Everyday at work I am confronted with a new and interesting challenge to better serve our guest.  We treat every customer like they are a guest in our home when they enter the front door.  I have never worked for a place that cares more for the customers that walk through the front door.</p>  
<p>I'm a bit of a nerd and love sci fi, Marvel, Star Trek and especially Star Wars.  I am very lucky to be married to my best friend who shares these same interest.  I am also very lucky to have the support of my family.  I know that there are many new challenges ahead and I am ready to take them all on!</p>
